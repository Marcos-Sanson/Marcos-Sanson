# Welcome to My GitHub!

I am a Computer Science Student at Grand Valley State University and an Undergraduate Researcher. My current research focuses on machine learning (ML) and evolutionary computation (EC).

I am passionate about learning, applying new technologies, and solving complex problems. I have completed projects and worked across the United States and internationally, including in Spain.
